Make sure carefully explore data make conservative quality assurance decisions information limited. Tips: query filters WQP work within fields ORs. example: Characteristics: choose pH & - ’s . means retrieve pH data available. States: Similarly, choose VA IL, ’s . means retrieve VA IL data available. Combinations fields ANDs, State/VA Characteristic/”. means receive data available VA. “Characteristic” “Characteristic Type” also work . means Characteristic must fall within CharacteristicGroup filters used, get error. “siteid” general term WQP uses describe Site IDs USGS databases Monitoring Location Identifiers (Water Quality Portal). monitoring location Water Quality Portal (WQP) unique Monitoring Location Identifier, regardless database derives.
