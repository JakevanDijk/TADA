<p>To install TADA, currently you need to install from GitHub using
remotes (shown) or devtools.</p>
<p>First, install and load the “remotes” package specifying the repo.
This is needed before installing TADA because it is only available on
GitHub (not CRAN).</p>

<h2 id="retrieve-wqp-data">Retrieve WQP data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#retrieve-wqp-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>WQP data is retrieved and processed for compatibility with TADA. This
function, <strong>TADAdataRetrieval</strong>, builds on the USGS
dataRetrieval package functions. It joins four WQP profiles (i.e., Site
metadata, Sample Results (narrow), Sample Results (physical/chemical
metadata), and Project metadata. In addition, it changes all data in the
Characteristic, Speciation, Fraction, and Unit fields to uppercase,
removes true duplicates, and addressed result values that include
special characters.</p>
<p>This function uses the same inputs as the dataRetrieval
<code>readWQPdata</code> function. <code>readWQPdata</code> does not
restrict the characteristics pulled from <a href="https://www.waterqualitydata.us/" class="external-link">Water Quality Portal (WQP)</a>.
You may specify the desired characteristics by using, for instance:
characteristicName = “pH”.</p>
<p>Data retrieval filters include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>startDate</p></li>
<li><p>endDate</p></li>
<li><p>characteristicName</p></li>
<li><p>sampleMedia</p></li>
<li><p>siteType</p></li>
<li><p>statecode (review list of possible state and territory <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/state.txt" class="external-link">abbreviations</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>countycode</p></li>
<li><p>siteid</p></li>
<li><p>organization</p></li>
<li><p>project</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware that the default TADAdataRetrieval function
automatically runs the TADA <strong>autoclean</strong> and
<strong>ConvertSpecialChars</strong> functions. Both are both required
for subsequent functions within the TADA R package to run. As a general
rule, TADA functions do not change any contents in the WQP-served
columns (enter <em>?ConvertSpecialChars</em> and <em>?autoclean</em>
into the console for more details). Instead, they add new columns with
the prefix “TADA.” The following columns are numeric versions of their
WQP origins:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="op">-</span>   <span class="va">TADA.ResultMeasureValue</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="op">-</span>   <span class="va">TADA.DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="op">-</span>   <span class="va">TADA.LatitudeMeasure</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="op">-</span>   <span class="va">TADA.LongitudeMeasure</span></span></code></pre>
<p>These functions also add the columns
TADA.ResultMeasureValueDataTypes.Flag and
TADA.DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValueDataTypes.Flag, which
provide information about the result values that is needed to address
censored data later on (i.e., nondetections). Specifically, these new
columns flag if special characters are included in result values, and
specifies what the special characters are.</p>
<p>Downloads using TADAdataRetrieval will have the same columns each
time, but be aware that data are uploaded to the Water Quality Portal by
individual organizations, which may or may not follow the same
conventions. Data and metadata quality are not guaranteed! Make sure to
carefully explore any data and make conservative quality assurance
decisions where information is limited.</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>All the query filters for the WQP work as an AND but within the
fields there are ORs. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Characteristics: If you choose pH &amp; DO - it’s an OR. This
means you will retrieve both pH OR DO data if available.</p></li>
<li><p>States: Similarly, if you choose VA and IL, it’s an OR. This
means you will retrieve both VA OR IL data if available.</p></li>
<li><p>Combinations of fields are ANDs, such as State/VA AND
Characteristic/DO”. This means you will receive all DO data available in
VA.</p></li>
<li><p>“Characteristic” and “Characteristic Type” also work as an AND.
This means that the Characteristic must fall within the
CharacteristicGroup if both filters are being used, if not you will get
an error.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The “siteid” is a general term WQP uses to describe both Site IDs
from USGS databases and Monitoring Location Identifiers (from the Water
Quality Portal). Each monitoring location in the Water Quality Portal
(WQP) has a unique Monitoring Location Identifier, regardless of the
database from which it derives. The Monitoring Location Identifier from
the WQP is the concatenated Organization Identifier plus the Site ID
number. Site IDs that only include a number are only unique identifiers
for monitoring locations within USGS NWIS or EPA’s WQX databases
separately.</p></li>

</h2>
<p>Uncomment below if you would like to review differences between the
profiles you would get using readWQPdata vs. TADAdataRetrieval. The
profiles are different because TADAdataRetrieval automatically joins in
data from multiple WQP profiles, and does some additional data cleaning
as part of the data retrieval process.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Use the code below to download data from the WQP using
TADAdataRetrieval. Edit the code chuck below to define your own WQP
query inputs.</p>
<p>Note: TADAdataRetrieval (by leveraging dataRetrieval), automatically
converts the date times to UTC. It also automatically converts the data
to dates, datetimes, numerics based on a standard algorithm.</p>

<p>Option 2: Alternatively, you can use the data.table::fread function
to read in a web service call for any WQP profile (un-comment).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># New_Draft_fullphyschem &lt;- data.table::fread("https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Result/search?countrycode=US&amp;statecode=US%3A49&amp;siteid=UTAHDWQ_WQX-4925610&amp;startDateLo=01-01-2015&amp;startDateHi=12-31-2016&amp;mimeType=csv&amp;zip=no&amp;sorted=yes&amp;dataProfile=fullPhysChem&amp;providers=NWIS&amp;providers=STEWARDS&amp;providers=STORET")</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Extra tip:</strong> Note that the web service call built
using the Water Quality Portal uses the inputs startDateLo and
startDateHi rather than startDate and endDate, and dates are in the
format MM-DD-YYYY rather than the TADAdataRetrieval and dataRetrieval
format of YYYY-MM-DD. The functions use the latter format rather than
the web service call date format because YYYY-MM-DD is a more easily
utilized format in the R coding environment. However, users of USGS’s
dataRetrieval may use the date format MM-DD-YYYY <em>only if</em> they
specify with “startDateLo” and “startDateHi” inputs. For coding
consistency, it is recommended users stick with YYYY-MM-DD.</p>
<p>Option 3: If you need to download a large amount of data from across
a large area, and the TADAdataRetrieval function is not working due to
WQP timeout issues, then the <strong>TADABigdataRetrieval</strong>
function may work better.</p>
<p>This function does multiple synchronous data calls to the WQP
(waterqualitydata.us). It uses the WQP summary service to limit the
sites downloaded to only those with relevant data. It pulls back data
from set number of stations at a time and then joins the data back
together to produce a single TADA compatible dataframe as the
output.</p>
<p>See ?TADABigdataRetrieval for more details. WARNING, this can take
multiple HOURS to run. The total run time depends on your query
inputs.</p>

<p>The TADA <strong>InvalidCoordinates</strong> function identifies and
flags potentially invalid coordinate data. While its functionality is
showcased here, it is always important to review any invalid outputs
before cleaning to reduce the risk of leaving out usable data/sites.</p>
<p>Allowable values for clean_outsideUSA are “no”, “remove”, or “change
sign”. The default is “no” which flags latitude and longitude
coordinates outside the USA. Assigning clean_ousideUSA = “remove” will
remove rows of data with coordinates outside the USA. And assigning
clean_outsideUSA = “change sign” will flip the sign of latitude or
longitude coordinates flagged as outside the USA. The “change sign”
option should only be used when it is known that coordinates were
entered with the wrong sign in WQX; additionally, the data owner should
fix these incorrect coordinates in the raw data through the WQX - for
assistance email the WQX help desk: WQX@epa.gov</p>
<p>Allowable values for clean_imprecise are TRUE or FALSE. The default
is FALSE which flags rows of data with invalid or imprecise coordinates
without removing them. Assigning clean_imprecise = TRUE will remove rows
of data with invalid or imprecise coordinates.</p>
<p>Allowable values for errorsonly are TRUE or FALSE. The default is
FALSE which keeps all rows of data regardless of flag status. Assigning
errorsonly = TRUE filters the dataframe to show only rows of data which
are flagged.</p>
<p>When clean_outsideUSA = “no” and/or clean_imprecise = FALSE, a column
will be appended titled “TADA.InvalidCoordinates.Flag” with the
following flags (if relevant to dataframe):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the latitude is less than zero, the row will be flagged with
“LAT_OutsideUSA”. (Exception for American Samoa)</p></li>
<li><p>If the longitude is greater than zero AND less than 145, the row
will be flagged as “LONG_OutsideUSA”. (Exceptions for Guam and the
Northern Mariana Islands)</p></li>
<li><p>If the latitude or longitude contains the string, “999”, the row
will be flagged as invalid.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, precision can be measured by the number of decimal
places in the latitude and longitude provided. If either does not have
any numbers to the right of the decimal point, the row will be flagged
as “Imprecise”.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>ConvertDepthUnits</strong> function converts depth units
to a consistent unit. Depth values and units are most commonly
associated with lake data, and are populated in the
<em>ActivityDepthHeightMeasure</em>,
<em>ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure</em>,
<em>ActivityBottomDepthHeightMeasure</em>, and
<em>ResultDepthHeightMeasure</em> Result Value/Unit columns.</p>
<p>This function first checks the dataframe for depth profile data.
Where depth profile columns are populated, the function appends
‘Conversion Factor’ columns and populates those columns based on the
original unit and the target unit, which is defined in the ‘unit’
argument. A ‘Depth Target Unit’ column is also appended, indicating the
unit all selected depth data is converted to. When transform = FALSE,
the output includes all ‘Conversion Factor’ columns and the ‘Depth
Target Unit’ column. When transform = TRUE, the output includes
converted depth data and the ‘Depth Target Unit’ column, which acts as a
flag indicating which rows have been converted. Default is transform =
TRUE.</p>
<p>The depth profile function can harmonize the depth units across all
the following fields (or only a specific one):
“ActivityDepthHeightMeasure”, “ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure”,
“ActivityBottomDepthHeightMeasure”, “ResultDepthHeightMeasure”). It
creates new result value/unit columns with the prefix “TADA.” to all
converted columns. The default is to check all four Depth Height
columns.</p>
<p>Allowable values for ‘unit’ are either ‘m’ (meter), ‘ft’ (feet), or
‘in’ (inch). ‘unit’ accepts only one allowable value as an input.
Default is unit = “m”.</p>

</h2>
<p>The <strong>AggregatedContinuousData</strong> function checks for and
removes statistically aggregated high frequency (i.e., continuous) data,
if present.</p>
<p>The Water Quality Portal (WQP) is not currently designed to store
high-frequency sensor data (more than 1 value per day). However,
sometimes data providers choose to aggregate their continuous data to a
daily avg, max, or min value, and then submit that aggregated data to
the WQP through WQX. Alternatively, some organizations aggregate their
high frequency data (15 min or 1 hour data) to 2 or 4 hour interval
averages, and they also submit that data to the WQP through WQX. This
type of high frequency data may (or may not) be suitable for integration
with discrete water quality data for assessments. Therefore, this
function uses metadata submitted by data providers to flag rows with
aggregated continuous data. This is done by flagging results where the
ResultDetectionConditionText = “Reported in Raw Data (attached)”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When clean = FALSE, a column titled
“TADA.AggregatedContinuousData” is added to the dataframe to indicate if
the row includes aggregated continuous data, “Y”, or not, “N”.</p></li>
<li><p>When clean = TRUE, rows with aggregated continuous data are
removed from the dataframe and no column will be appended. The default
is clean = TRUE.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An additional input called errorsonly will allow the user to filter
data to show only rows of aggregated continuous data. Allowable values
for errorsonly are TRUE or FALSE. The default is FALSE which keeps all
rows of data regardless of flag status. Assigning errorsonly = TRUE
filters the dataframe to show only rows of data which are flagged
“Y”.</p>

<p>This function checks to see if there is any information in the column
“QAPPApprovedIndicator”. Some organizations submit data for this field
to indicate if the data produced has an approved Quality Assurance
Project Plan (QAPP) or not. In this field, Y indicates yes, N indicates
no.</p>
<p>This function has three default inputs: clean = TRUE, cleanNA =

</h2>
<p>Censored data are measurements for which the true value is not known,
but we can estimate the value based on lower or upper detection
conditions and limit types. TADA fills missing
<em>TADA.ResultMeasureValue</em> and
<em>TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode</em> values with values and units
from <em>TADA.DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue</em> and
<em>TADA.DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureUnitCode</em>,
respectively, using the autoclean function. In other words, detection
limit information is copied and pasted into the result value column when
the original value is NA and detection limit information is available.
The two columns TADA focuses on to define and flag censored data are
<em>ResultDetectionConditionText</em> and
<em>DetectionQuantitationLimitTypeName</em>.</p>
<p>The TADA package currently has functions that summarize censored data
incidence in the dataset and perform simple substitutions of censored
data values, including x times the detection limit and random selection
of a value between 0 and the detection limit. The user may specify the
methods used for non-detects and over-detects separately in the input to
the <strong>simpleCensoredMethods</strong> function.</p>
<p>All censored data functions depend first on the
<strong>idCensoredData</strong> utility function, which assigns a
<em>TADA.CensoredData.Flag</em> to all data records and identifies
over-detects from non-detects using the
<em>ResultDetectionConditionText</em> and
<em>DetectionQuantitationLimitTypeName</em>. This utility function is
automatically run within the summary and simple methods functions if the
dataset does not contain the <em>TADA.CensoredData.Flag</em>. All
records receive one of the following classifications: - Uncensored - Not
filled with detection limit value; a detection. - Non-Detect -
Left-censored - Over-Detect - Right-censored - Other Condition/Limit
Populated - detection condition or limit type are ambiguous or not
associated with a lower/upper detection limit. - Conflict between
Condition and Limit - detection condition and limit type for a single
record do not agree, e.g. one suggests over-detect and the other
suggests non-detect. - Censored but not Categorized - detection
condition or limit type is not characterized in the TADA reference
tables, which are based on WQX domain tables. Causes function to produce
a warning.</p>
<p>In the example below, we first summarize the censored data in the
dataset using the default grouping variables
<em>TADA.CharacteristicName</em>,
<em>TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode</em>,<em>TADA.ResultSampleFractionText</em>,
and <em>TADA.MethodSpecificationName</em>. The user can specify any
columns in the TADA dataframe they’d like to use to aggregate their
censored data counts. For example, some may want to aggregate both by
characteristic and HUC or characteristic and monitoring location.</p>
<p>The next step we take in this example is to perform simple
conversions to the censored data in the dataset: we keep over-detects as
is (no conversion made) and convert non-detect values to 0.5 times the
detection limit (half the detection limit). Please review
<strong>?summarizeCensoredData</strong> and
<strong>?simpleCensoredMethods</strong> for more information.</p>

Standards<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#transform-characteristic-speciation-and-unit-values-to-tada-standards"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <strong>HarmonizeRefTable</strong> function generates a
harmonization reference table that is specific to the input dataframe.
Users can review how their input data relates to standard TADA values
for the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>TADA.CharacteristicName</p></li>
<li><p>TADA.ResultSampleFractionText</p></li>
<li><p>TADA.MethodSpecificationName</p></li>
<li><p>TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>HarmonizeData</strong> function then compares the input
dataframe to the TADA Harmonization Reference Table. The purpose of the
function is to make similar data consistent and therefore easier to
compare and analyze.</p>
<p>Users can also edit the reference file to meet their needs if
desired. The download argument can be used to save the harmonization
file to your current working directory when download = TRUE, the default
is download = FALSE.</p>
<p>Optional outputs include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>the dataframe with Harmonization columns appended,</p></li>
<li><p>the dataframe with TADA.CharacteristicName,
TADA.ResultSampleFractionText, TADA.MethodSpecificationName, and
TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode converted to TADA standards
or</p></li>
<li><p>the four fields converted with most Harmonization Reference Table
columns appended. Default is transform = TRUE and flag = TRUE.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some examples of how the HarmonizeData function can be
used:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>TADA.ResultSampleFractionText specifies forms of constituents. In
some cases, a single *TADA.CharacteristicName** will have both “Total”
and “Dissolved” forms specified, which should not be combined. In these
cases, each TADA.CharacteristicName and TADA.ResultSampleFractionText
combination is given a different identifier. This identifier can be used
later on to identify comparable data groups for calculating statistics
and creating figures for each combination.</p></li>
<li><p>Some variables have different names but represent the same
constituent (e.g., “Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (Organic N &amp; NH3)” and
“Kjeldahl nitrogen”). The HarmonizeData function gives a consistent name
(and identifier) to synonyms.</p></li>
