## Contribute to TADA!

We encourage you to read this project's [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/USEPA/TADA/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](https://github.com/USEPA/TADA/blob/develop/LICENSE.md), and its [README](https://github.com/USEPA/TADA/blob/develop/readme.md).

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an EPA open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask --- or submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is we'll politely ask you to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

No matter who you are, if you spot an error, omission, or bug, you're welcome to open an issue in this repo!

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a third-party website that offers version-controlled repositories that developers and scientists can use to collaborate on projects (e.g., software, text, manuscripts, etc.) in real-time. GitHub also provides social networking features that allow developers to follow open-source projects, share code and learn how code changes are made throughout the development process. GitHub is so named because it utilizes the open-source version control system (VCS) known as Git.

## Issues

-   If you see an error or have feedback, the best way to let us know is to file an issue.

## Branches

-   To contribute a specific change or new code, outside contributors can create a new branch or fork this repo from the **develop** branch, then create a pull request for us to review.

All new development currently happens in the **develop** branch. When the code is polished and ready for testing, it moves to the **staging** branch. The **main** branch is reserved for finalized code. To contribute a specific change or new code, outside contributors can create a new branch or fork this repo from the **develop** branch, then create a pull request for us to review.

Each contributor should work in a new, separate branch for each task. When the task is complete, the contributor can create a pull request for changes to be merged. We will review the contribution and delete the branch once the merge is complete. GitHub best practice is to not reuse branches after merge is requested via a pull request.

Complete the pull request by detailing all fixes and contributions, and tagging TADA repo admins who should review the work. For this package, please tag cristinamullin (Cristina Mullin) and mthawley (Shelly Thawley).

Repository Administrators will review code contributions from external collaborators and integrate code commits into source code. This is done to ensure code stability and consistency and prevent degradation of code performance. After review, the admin will either accept the submission, recommend specific improvements to the submission, or in some cases reject the submission. To avoid outright rejection, developers contributing code should contact the Repository Administrator early in the development process and maintain contact throughout to help ensure the submission is compatible with the code base and is a robust addition.

## Open-Source Code Policy  

Effective August 8, 2016, the [OMB Mandate: M-16-21; Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/) applies to new custom-developed code created or procured by EPA consistent with the scope and applicability requirements of Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Federal Source Code Policy. In general, it states that all new custom-developed code by Federal Agencies should be made available and reusable as open-source code.

The EPA specific implementation of OMB Mandate M-16-21 is addressed in the [System Life Cycle Management Procedure](https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policy-procedures-and-guidance-system-life-cycle-management-slcm). EPA has chosen to use GitHub as its version control system as well as its inventory of open-source code projects. EPA uses GitHub to inventory its custom-developed, open-source code and generate the necessary metadata file that is then posted to code.gov for broad reuse in compliance with OMB Mandate M-16-21.
