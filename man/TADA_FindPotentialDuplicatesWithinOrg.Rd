\title{Identify Potential Duplicate Data Uploads Within An Organization (UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT)}
\usage{
TADA_FindPotentialDuplicatesWithinOrg(.data, handling_method = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{handling_method}{Defaults to 'none'. When input is 'none', function
flags groups of potentially duplicated results, but makes no decisions on
which (if any) should be selected/excluded. Alternatively, user may
populate handling_method = 'pick_one' and function will randomly select one
result in each group and flag all others as duplicates.}
}
\value{
The same input TADA dataframe with additional columns: a
TADA.ProbableDuplicate column indicating if there is evidence that two or
more results are duplicated, a TADA.DuplicateID column, containing a
number unique to results that may represent duplicated measurement events,
and one or more TADA.SiteGroup columns indicating monitoring locations
within the distance buffer from each other.
}
\description{
Identifies data records uploaded by the same organization with the same date,
time, monitoring location, activity type, characteristic name, fraction,
taxonomic name, depth columns, and result value and flags as potential
duplicates. However, it is at the discretion of the data user to determine if
the data records are unique or represent overlap that could cause issues in
the data analysis.
