\usage{
PotentialDuplicateRowID(.data, clean = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; removes potential duplicate data from
the dataframe when clean = TRUE. When clean = FALSE, a column indicating
potential duplicate rows with a unique number linking rows is appended to the
input data set. Default is clean = TRUE.}
}
\value{
When clean = FALSE, the following column will be added to you dataframe:
TADA.PotentialDupRowID. This column flags potential duplicate rows of data
in your dataframe, and assigns each potential duplicate combination a unique number
linking the two potential duplication rows. When clean = FALSE the first of
each group of potential duplicate rows will be removed from the dataframe
and no column is appended.
}
\description{
Sometimes multiple organizations submit the exact same data to Water Quality
Portal (WQP), which can affect water quality analyses and assessments. This
function checks for and identifies data that is identical in all fields
excluding organization-specific and comment text fields. Each pair or group
of potential duplicate rows is flagged with a unique ID. When clean = TRUE,
the function retains the first occurrence of each potential duplicate in the
dataframe. Default is clean = TRUE.
