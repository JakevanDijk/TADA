TADA Profile Check

This function checks if the column names in a dataframe include the TADA
profile fields. It is used at the beginning of TADA functions to ensure the
input data frame is suitable (i.e. is either the full physical/chemical
results profile downloaded from WQP or the TADA profile template downloaded
from the EPA TADA webpage.)

Boolean result indicating whether or not the input dataframe contains
all of the TADA profile fields.

\description{
Removes complex biological data. Removes non-water media samples.
Removes rows of data that are true duplicates. Capitalizes fields to harmonize
data. This function includes and runs the TADA "MeasureValueSpecialCharacters"
function as well.
}
\details{
Within "BiologicalIntentName", only the allowable values "tissue", "toxicity",
and "NA" apply to non-biological data (the function removes all others).
Toxicity and fish tissue data will be kept, but other types of biological
monitoring data will not.

We decided to make some fields uppercase that way they're more compatible
with the WQX validation reference tables and to avoid any issues with
case-sensitivity when joining data. Therefore, we might need to tack on any
immediate QA steps (removing true duplicates, converting result values to numeric,
capitalizing letters, etc.) to this function, as well as the other retrieval functions.
