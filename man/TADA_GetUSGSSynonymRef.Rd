\usage{
TADA_GetUSGSSynonymRef()
}
\value{
Dataframe of USGS only units and speciations and their WQX compatible
targets/synonyms.
}
\description{
This internal reference file includes USGS only units/speciations. It was
created in July 2023 using the pcodes domain table from NWIS
(https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/codes-and-parameters/parameters). All USGS units
and speciations are given a target unit and speciation that is synonymous, but
adheres to the WQX schema (WQX measure unit domain table).
}
\details{
This reference file is used in the TADA_ConvertResultUnits() function where
synonymous units and speciations are harmonized before units are then also
harmonized/converted to WQX targets.
