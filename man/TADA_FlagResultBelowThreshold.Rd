\title{Check Result Value Against WQX Lower Threshold}
\usage{
TADA_FlagResultBelowThreshold(.data, clean = TRUE, errorsonly = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; removes data that is below the lower WQX
threshold from the dataframe when clean = TRUE. Default is clean = TRUE.}

\item{errorsonly}{Boolean argument; filters data to show only the values
flagged as below the lower WQX threshold when errorsonly = TRUE. Default is
errorsonly = FALSE.}
}
\value{
The input TADA dataset with the added
TADA.BelowNationalWQXLowerThreshold column. This column flags rows with
data that are below the lower WQX threshold. When clean = FALSE and
errorsonly = TRUE, the dataframe is filtered to show only the rows which
are flagged as below the WQX threshold; the column
TADA.ResultValueBelowLowerThreshold.Flag is still appended. When clean =
TRUE and errorsonly = FALSE, data that is below the lower WQX threshold is
removed from the dataframe. When clean = TRUE and errorsonly = TRUE, the
function does not execute and an error message is returned. The defaults
are clean = TRUE and errorsonly = FALSE.
}
\description{
EPA's Water Quality Exchange (WQX) has generated statistics and data from
millions of water quality data points around the country. This functions
leverages that statistical data from WQX to flag any data that is below the
lower threshold of result values submitted to WQX for a given characteristic.
When clean = TRUE, rows with values that are below the lower WQX threshold
are removed from the dataframe and no column will be appended. Default is
clean = TRUE. When errorsonly = TRUE, the dataframe is filtered to show only
rows with values that are flagged below the lower WQX threshold. Default is
errorsonly = FALSE
}
\examples{
# Load example dataset:
data(Nutrients_Utah)

# Remove data that is below the lower WQX threshold from the dataframe:
WQXLowerThreshold_clean <- TADA_FlagResultBelowThreshold(Nutrients_Utah)

# Flag, but do not remove, data that is below the lower WQX threshold in
# new column titled "TADA.ResultValueBelowLowerThreshold.Flag":
WQXLowerThreshold_flags <- TADA_FlagResultBelowThreshold(Nutrients_Utah, clean = FALSE)

# Show only data that is below the lower WQX threshold:
WQXLowerThreshold_flagsonly <- TADA_FlagResultBelowThreshold(Nutrients_Utah,
clean = FALSE, errorsonly = TRUE)
