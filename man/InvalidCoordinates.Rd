\usage{
InvalidCoordinates(.data, clean_outsideUSA = FALSE, clean_imprecise = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean_outsideUSA}{Boolean argument; removes data with coordinates outside
of the United States when clean_outsideUSA = TRUE. Default is clean = FALSE.}

\item{clean_imprecise}{Boolean arguments; removes imprecise data when 
clean_imprecise = TRUE. Default is clean_imprecise = FALSE.}
}
\value{
When either the clean_outsideUSA or clean_imprecise argument is FALSE,
a column flagging rows with the respective QA check is appended to the input
dataset. When either argument is TRUE, "invalid" or "imprecise" data is
removed, respectively.
}
\description{
Function identifies and flags invalid coordinate data. When clean = FALSE, 
a column will be appended titled "TADA.InvalidCoordinates" with the following
flags (if relevant to dataset):
}
\details{
BELOW TBD 

1) If the LONG has a + sign, the function assumes this was a data
submission error because it is outside of the US. + LONGS will be automatically
changed to - 
2) If the LAT or LONG includes the specific strings,
000 or 999, or if the LAT is outside of the -90 to 90 range and LONG
is outside of the -180 to 180 range, the row is flagged as "Invalid";
3) Precision can be measured by the number of decimal places in the LAT 
and LONG provided. If the LAT or LONG does not have any numbers to the right of the 
decimal point, the row will be flagged as "Imprecise".
