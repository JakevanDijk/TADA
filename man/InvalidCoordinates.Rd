\usage{
InvalidCoordinates(.data, clean_outsideUSA = FALSE, clean_imprecise = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataset}

\item{clean}{Two boolean arguments. Default is clean = FALSE and 
imprecise = FALSE. When clean = TRUE and imprecise = TRUE, data transformations
occur and data is removed from the dataset.}
}
\value{
When clean = FALSE and imprecise = FALSE, data is flagged but
not removed from the dataset.
}
\description{
When clean = FALSE, a column will be appended titled "InvalidCoordinates"
with the following flags (if relevant to dataset):
}
\details{
BELOW TBD 

1) If the LONG has a + sign, the function assumes this was a data
submission error because it is outside of the US. + LONGS will be 
changed to - 
2) If the LAT or LONG includes the specific strings,
000 or 999, or if the LAT is outside of the -90 to 90 range and LONG
is outside of the -180 to 180 range, the row is flagged as "Invalid";
3) Precision can be measured by the number of decimal places in the LAT 
and LONG provided. If the LAT or LONG does not have any numbers to the right of the 
decimal point, the row will be flagged as "Imprecise".
