\description{
This function identifies censored data records and characterizes them as non-detects
or over-detects based on the ResultDetectionConditionText and DetectionQuantitationLimitTypeName.
It also identifies records populated with limits and conditions that cannot be grouped
as over- or non-detects as "Other", and flags records where there is a conflict
between ResultDetectionConditionText and DetectionQuantitationLimitTypeName.
This function is used by default in the simpleCensoredMethods and summarizeCensoredData
functions, but can be used on its own.
