\description{
Organizations that submit data to the Water Quality Portal (WQP) sometimes 
include metadata with their results to indicate if the data produced has an
associated Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP). This check reviews data
submitted under the column "ProjectFileUrl" to determine if
a QAPP document is available to review. When clean=false, 
a column will be appended to flag results that do not have an associated 
QAPP document url provided. When clean = TRUE, rows with values that do not
have an associated QAPP document are removed from the dataset and no column
will be appended. This function should only be used to remove data if an 
accompanying QAPP document is required to use data in assessments
