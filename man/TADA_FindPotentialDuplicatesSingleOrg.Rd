\title{Identify Potentially Duplicated Data Uploads by a Single Organization (UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT)}
\usage{
TADA_FindPotentialDuplicatesSingleOrg(.data, handling_method = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{handling_method}{Defaults to 'none'. When input is 'none', function
flags groups of potentially duplicated results, but makes no decisions on
which (if any) should be selected/excluded. Alternatively, user may
populate handling_method = 'pick_one' and function will randomly select one
result in each group and flag all others as duplicates.}
}
\value{
The same input TADA dataframe with additional columns: a
TADA.SingleOrgDupGroupID column indicating whether a result is part of a
group that shares the same date, time, location, characteristic, etc. and
TADA.ResultSelectedSingleOrg, which defaults to 'Y' (all results
selected), unless the user specifies the handling method as 'pick_one', in
which case there exists one result (selected at random) in each duplicate group where
TADA.ResultSelectedSingleOrg = 'Y' and for all other results in the group
TADA.ResultSelectedSingleOrg = 'N'.
}
\description{
Identifies data records uploaded by the same organization with the same date,
time, monitoring location, activity type, characteristic name, fraction,
taxonomic name, depth columns, and result value and flags as potential
duplicates. However, it is at the discretion of the data user to determine if
the data records are unique or represent overlap that could cause issues in
the data analysis. Note, the dataset may contain data from multiple
organizations: the function performs the same analysis on data from each
organization.
}
\examples{
# Load dataset
data(Data_6Tribes_5y)
# If duplicates across organizations exist, pick the result belonging to "21PA_WQX" if available.
Data_6Tribes_5y_dups <- TADA_FindPotentialDuplicatesSingleOrg(Data_6Tribes_5y, handling_method = "pick_one")
table(Data_6Tribes_5y_dups$TADA.ResultSelectedSingleOrg)
