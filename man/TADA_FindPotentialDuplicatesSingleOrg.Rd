\title{Identify Potentially Duplicated Data Uploads by a Single Organization}
\usage{
TADA_FindPotentialDuplicatesSingleOrg(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}
}
\value{
The same input TADA dataframe with additional columns: a
TADA.SingleOrgDupGroupID column indicating whether a result is part of a
group that shares the same date, time, location, characteristic, etc. If
multiple rows include duplicates within a single organization, the rows will
have the same number identifier in the TADA.SingleOrgDupGroupID column.
In addition, the column TADA.SingleOrgDup.Flag is added, which randomly
flags rows within each TADA.SingleOrgDupGroupID group for removal. Rows
randomly selected for potential removal within a duplicate group will have the
TADA.SingleOrgDup.Flag = 'Duplicate' and  all other results in the group will have
the value TADA.SingleOrgDup.Flag = 'Unique'.
}
\description{
Identifies data records uploaded by the same organization with the same date,
time, monitoring location, activity type, characteristic name, fraction,
taxonomic name, depth columns, and result value and flags as potential
duplicates. However, it is at the discretion of the data user to determine if
the data records are unique or represent overlap that could cause issues in
the data analysis. Note, the dataset may contain data from multiple
organizations: the function performs the same analysis on data from each
organization.

\examples{
# Load dataset
data(Data_6Tribes_5y)
# If duplicates exist, identify and flag them for removal
Data_6Tribes_5y_dups <- TADA_FindPotentialDuplicatesSingleOrg(Data_6Tribes_5y)
table(Data_6Tribes_5y_dups$TADA.SingleOrgDup.Flag)
