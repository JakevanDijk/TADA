TADA-compatible dataframe
}
\description{
Retrieve data from Water Quality Portal (WQP) and generate a TADA-compatible
dataframe. Note that the inputs (e.g. project, organization, siteType) with the
exceptions of endDate and startDate match the web service call format from the
online WQP GUI. endDate and startDate match the format suggested in USGS's
dataRetrieval package (endDate = "YYYY-MM-DD"), which is a more familiar date
format for R users than the WQP GUI's endDateHi = "MM-DD-YYYY".
}
\details{
This function will create and/or edit the following columns:
TADA.DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Flag
DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue
DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Original
ResultMeasureValue.Original
TADA.ResultMeasureValue.Flag
ResultMeasureValue

Keep in mind that all the query filters for the WQP work as an AND,
but within the fields there are ORs. For example, within
characteristicName – if you enter, c("pH", "Dissolved oxygen (DO)), – it’s an OR.
Meaning that you will be back "pH" or "Dissolved oxygen (DO)" data. Similarly, if you
enter c("Virginia", "Illinois"), it’s an OR. But the combo of fields are ANDs.
Such as State/Virginia AND Characteristic/Dissolved oxygen (DO)". Meaning, you
will get get back only Dissolved oxygen (DO) from Virginia.
characteristicName and Characteristic Group also work as an AND, therefore the
characteristicName must fall within the Characteristic Group when both are entered.

All data cleaning and transformations are done directly to the
"ResultMeasureValue" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue" columns,
however the original "ResultMeasureValue" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue"
columns and values from the WQP are preserved in these new fields,
"ResultMeasureValue.Original" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Original".
Additionally, "TADA.ResultMeasureValue.Flag" and
"TADA.DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Flag" are created to track and changes made
to the "ResultMeasureValue" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue" columns;
and to provide information about the result values that is needed to address
censored data later on (i.e., nondetections)

Users can reference the \href{https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/storage-and-retrieval-and-water-quality-exchange-domain-services-and-downloads}{WQX domain tables}
to find allowable values for queries, e.g., reference the WQX domain table to find countycode and statecode: https://cdx.epa.gov/wqx/download/DomainValues/County_CSV.zip
Alternatively, you can use the WQP services to find areas where data is available in the US: https://www.waterqualitydata.us/Codes/countycode

See ?ConvertSpecialChars and ?autoclean documentation for more information.

Note: TADAdataRetrieval (by leveraging dataRetrieval),  automatically converts
the date times to UTC. It also automatically converts the data to dates,
datetimes, numerics based on a standard algorithm. See: ?dataRetrieval::readWQPdata
