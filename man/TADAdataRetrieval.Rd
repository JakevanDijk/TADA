\arguments{
\item{statecode}{Code that identifies a state}

\item{countycode}{Code that identifies a county}

\item{siteid}{Unique monitoring station identifier}

\item{siteType}{Type of waterbody}

\value{
TADA-compatible dataframe
}
\description{
Retrieve data from Water Quality Portal (WQP) and output a TADA-compatible
dataset.
}
\details{
Keep in mind that all the query filters for the WQP work as an AND
but within the fields there are ORs. So for example,
characteristics – if you choose pH & DO – it’s an OR. Similarly, if you
choose VA and IL, it’s an OR. But the combo of fields are ANDs.
Such as State/VA AND Characteristic/DO".
"Characteristic" and "Characteristic Group" also work as an AND.

This function will create and/or edit the following columns:
TADA.DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Flag
DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue
DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Original
ResultMeasureValue.Original
TADA.ResultMeasureValue.Flag
ResultMeasureValue

All data cleaning and transformations are done directly to the
"ResultMeasureValue" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue" columns,
however the original "ResultMeasureValue" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue"
columns and values from the WQP are preserved in these new fields,
"ResultMeasureValue.Original" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Original".
Additionally, "TADA.ResultMeasureValue.Flag" and
"TADA.DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Flag" are created to track and changes made
to the "ResultMeasureValue" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue" columns;
and to provide information about the result values that is needed to address
censored data later on (i.e., nondetections)

See ?MeasureValueSpecialCharacters and ?autoclean documentation for more information.
