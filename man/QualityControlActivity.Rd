\usage{
QualityControlActivity(
  .data,
  clean = c("none", "all", "duplicates", "blanks", "calibrations", "other"),
  errorsonly = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe which must include the column 'ActivityTypeCode'}

\item{clean}{Character argument with options "none", "all",
"duplicates", or "blanks", "calibrations", or "other". The default is
clean = "none" which does not remove any rows of data. When clean = "all",
any rows of data flagged as a Quality Control sample will be removed. When
clean = "duplicates", any rows of data flagged as a duplicate Quality Control
sample will be removed. When clean = "blanks", any rows of data flagged as a
blank Quality Control sample will be removed. When clean = "calibrations", any
rows of data flagged as a calibration check or spiked Quality Control sample
will be removed. And when clean = "other", any rows of data flagged as some
other type of Quality Control sample will be removed.}

\item{errorsonly}{Boolean argument; the default is errorsonly = FALSE. When
errorsonly = TRUE, the function will filter the dataframe to show only the
rows of data flagged as Quality Control samples.}
}
\value{
This function adds the column "TADA.ActivityType.Flag" to the dataframe
which flags quality control samples based on the "ActivityTypeCode" column. When
clean = "none", all flagged data are kept in the dataframe. When clean = "all",
all flagged data are removed from the dataframe. When clean = "duplicates",
data flagged as QC duplicates are removed from the dataframe. When clean =
"blanks", data flagged as QC blanks are removed from the dataframe. When
clean = "calibrations", data flagged as QC calibration checks or spikes are
removed from the dataframe. When clean = "other", data flagged as other QC
samples are removed from the dataframe. When errorsonly = TRUE, the dataframe
is filtered to show only the flagged data. When errorsonly = FALSE, the full,
cleaned dataframe is returned. The default is clean = "none" and errorsonly = FALSE.
}
\description{
This function checks for and flags or removes samples denoted as quality control
activities based on the 'ActivityTypeCode' column. The function will flag
duplicate samples as "QC_duplicate", blank samples as "QC_blank", calibration
or spiked samples as "QC_calibration", and other QC samples as "QC_other".
}
\examples{
# Load example dataset:
data(Nutrients_Utah)

# Flag and keep all QC samples:
QualityControlActivity(Nutrients_Utah)

# Flag QC samples and filter to flagged data only:
QualityControlActivity(Nutrients_Utah, errorsonly = TRUE)

# Remove all QC samples:
QualityControlActivity(Nutrients_Utah, clean = "all")

# Remove only duplicate QC samples:
QualityControlActivity(Nutrients_Utah, clean = "duplicates")

# Remove only blank QC samples:
QualityControlActivity(Nutrients_Utah, clean = "blanks")

# Remove only calibration checks or spiked QC samples:
QualityControlActivity(Nutrients_Utah, clean = "calibrations")

# Remove only other QC samples:
QualityControlActivity(Nutrients_Utah, clean = "other")

# Remove blank QC samples and filter to flagged data only:
QualityControlActivity(Nutrients_Utah, clean = "blanks", errorsonly = TRUE)
