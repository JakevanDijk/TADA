\usage{
autoclean(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}
}
\value{
autocleaned TADA data profile
}
\description{
Removes rows of data that are true duplicates. Creates new columns with prefix
"TADA." and capitalizes fields to harmonize data. This function includes and
runs the TADA "ConvertSpecialChars" function as well.
}
\details{
Within "BiologicalIntentName", only the allowable values "tissue", "toxicity",
and "NA" apply to non-biological data (the function removes all others).
Toxicity and fish tissue data will be kept, but other types of biological
monitoring data will not.

This function makes certain fields uppercase so that they're interoperable
with the WQX validation reference tables and to avoid any issues with
case-sensitivity when joining data. This function also performs immediate QA steps
(removes true duplicates, converts result values to numeric, capitalizes
letters, etc.). It can be run as a stand alone function or can be tacked onto
other functions.
