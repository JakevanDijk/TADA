\usage{
ConvertDepthUnits(
  .data,
  unit = "m",
  fields = c("ActivityDepthHeightMeasure", "ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure",
    "ActivityBottomDepthHeightMeasure", "ResultDepthHeightMeasure"),
  transform = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{unit}{Character string input indicating the target depth unit to use for
conversions. Allowable values for 'unit' are either "m" (meters), "ft" (feet),
or "in" (inches). 'unit' accepts only one allowable value as an input. The
default unit = "m".}

\item{fields}{Character string input indicating the relevant depth data fields
that will be converted to the desired target unit in new TADA column. Allowable
values for 'fields' are "ActivityDepthHeightMeasure", "ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure",
"ActivityBottomDepthHeightMeasure", and "ResultDepthHeightMeasure". The default
is to include all depth fields.}

\item{transform}{Boolean argument; The default is transform = TRUE.
When transform = TRUE, all depth data is converted to the target unit; and
no additional columns are added. When transform = FALSE, where depth data
is populated, the function appends columns indicating the target unit and
conversion factor for each row; and for each depth field. No conversions are
done at this time. A user can review the conversion factor information if
desired by using this feature.}
}
\value{
When transform = TRUE, the input dataframe is returned with all depth
data converted to the target unit; no additional columns are added.
When transform = FALSE, the input dataframe is returned with additional
columns including... be specific here ...
}
\description{
Default is transform = TRUE. When transform = TRUE, all depth data is converted
to a consistent unit. The converted depth value and unit are placed in a NEW
column with the same name as the original, plus the prefix "TADA." New columns
are only created if there are values/units in the column(s) of interest.
The default unit is "m" (meters), but a user can also choose
"ft" or "in". When transform = FALSE, where depth data is populated, the
function appends columns indicating the target unit and conversion factor for
each row; and for each depth field. No conversions are done at this time.
A user can review the conversion factor information if desired by using this
feature. All transformations are performed on columns created by this function
with the prefix "TADA." All WQP columns retain original values.

\examples{
# Load example dataset:
data(Nutrients_Utah)

# Convert all depth units to meters:
DepthUnitsConverted_m <- ConvertDepthUnits(Nutrients_Utah)

# Convert all depth units to feet:
DepthUnitsConverted_ft <- ConvertDepthUnits(Nutrients_Utah, unit = "ft")

# Convert only the "ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure" field to inches:
TopDepthUnitsConverted_in <- ConvertDepthUnits(Nutrients_Utah, 
unit = "in", fields = "ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure")

# Do not convert any depth units, but add columns for target units and 
# conversion factors for each depth measure:
DepthUnitsNotConverted <- ConvertDepthUnits(Nutrients_Utah, transform = FALSE)
