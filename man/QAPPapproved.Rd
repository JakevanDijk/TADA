\title{Check data for an approved QAPP}
\usage{
QAPPapproved(.data, clean = TRUE, cleanNA = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument with two possible values called "TRUE" and 
"FALSE". When clean=TRUE, rows of data where the QAPPApprovedIndicator equals
"N" will be removed. When, clean=FALSE, rows of data where the 
QAPPApprovedIndicator equals "N" will be retained.}

\item{cleanNA}{Boolean argument with two possible values called "TRUE" and 
"FALSE". When cleanNA=TRUE, rows of data where the QAPPApprovedIndicator 
equals "NA" will be removed. When, cleanNA=FALSE, rows of data where the 
the QAPPApprovedIndicator equals "NA" will be retained.}
}
\value{
When clean = FALSE and cleanNA = FALSE, no data is removed from the 
dataset.

\description{
Function checks data submitted under the column "QAPPApprovedIndicator".
Some organizations submit data for this field to indicate if the data 
produced has an approved Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) or not. 
Y indicates yes, N indicates no.  This function has two default inputs: 
clean = TRUE and cleanNA = FALSE. The default removes rows of data where the 
QAPPApprovedIndicator equals "N". Users could alternatively remove both N's
and NA's using the inputs clean = TRUE and cleanNA = TRUE. If both 
clean = FALSE and cleanNA = FALSE, the function will not make any changes to
the data.
}
\details{
Note: This is not a required field, so it is often left blank (NA) even if 
the data has an associated QAPP. All states and tribes that collect 
monitoring data using 106 funding (almost all state and tribal data in WQX) 
are required to have an EPA approved QAPP to receive 106 funding. Therefore,
most of these organizations data has an approved QAPP even if the data 
submitted to WQP is NA.
