\title{Flag or remove result without an approved QAPP}
\usage{
QAPPapproved(.data, clean = TRUE, cleanNA = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataset}

\item{clean}{Two boolean arguments: 1) remove data where the 
QAPPApprovedIndicator = "N"  when clean = TRUE; 2) remove data where the 
QAPPApprovedIndicator = NA  when cleanNA = TRUE. Default is clean = TRUE and 
cleanNA = FALSE.}

\item{cleanNA}{}
}
\value{
When clean = FALSE and cleanNA = FALSE, no data is removed from the 
dataset.
}
\description{
This check reviews data submitted under the column "QAPPApprovedIndicator".
Some organizations submit data for this field to indicate if the data 
produced has an approved Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) or not. 
Y indicates yes, N indicates no.  This function 
has two default inputs: clean = TRUE, cleanNA = FALSE. The default will
remove rows of data where the QAPPApprovedIndicator equals "N". Users could
alternatively remove both N's and NA's using the inputs: 
clean = TRUE, cleanNA = TRUE. If both clean = FALSE and cleanNA = FALSE, 
the function will not make any changes to the dataset.
}
\details{
Note: This is not a required field, so it is often left blank (NA) even if 
the data has an associated QAPP. All states and tribes that collect 
monitoring data using 106 funding (almost all state and tribal data in WQX) 
are required to have an EPA approved QAPP to receive 106 funding. Therefore,
most of these organizations data has an approved QAPP even if the data 
submitted to WQP is NA.
