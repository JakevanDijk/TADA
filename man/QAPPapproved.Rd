\description{
Organizations that submit data to the Water Quality Portal (WQP) sometimes 
include metadata with their results to indicate if the data produced has an
approved Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP). This check reviews data
submitted under the column "QAPPApprovedIndicator". When clean=false, 
a column will be appended to flag results that do not have an approved QAPP.
When clean = TRUE, rows with values that do not have an approved QAPP are 
removed from the dataset and no column will be appended.This function should
only be used to remove data if an approved QAPP is required to use data in 
water quality assessments
