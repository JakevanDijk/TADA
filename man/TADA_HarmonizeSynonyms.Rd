\usage{
TADA_HarmonizeSynonyms(.data, ref)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{ref}{Optional argument to specify which dataframe to use as a reference
file. The primary use for this argument is when a user has generated a
synonym reference file unique to their data, and they made changes to
that file.}
}
\value{
The input TADA dataframe with the TADA.CharacteristicName,
TADA.ResultSampleFractionText, TADA.MethodSpecificationName, and
TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode columns converted to the target values,
if supplied. Also includes additional columns
TADA.CharacteristicNameAssumptions, TADA.FractionAssumptions, and
TADA.SpeciationAssumptions populated with additional notes about the conversion
logic, and a TADA.Harmonized.Flag, indicating whether TADA columns were
changed in this function.
}
\description{
This function joins a synonym reference table to the dataset to convert
synonymous data to a unified naming format for easier aggregation, analysis,
and visualization. Users may populate the function with a dataset-specific
synonym table created from TADA_GetSynonymRef and reviewed/customized by the
user (recommended), or the default TADA-provided synonym table, containing
suggested synonym naming for some priority characteristics. Where a suggested
characteristic name, fraction, speciation, or unit is present, the function
will convert the TADA.CharacteristicName, TADA.ResultSampleFractionText,
TADA.MethodSpecificationName, and/or TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode to
the target format. In cases where a target unit or speciation differs from
the existing unit or speciation, the reference table will also apply
multiplication conversion factors to the TADA.ResultMeasureValue.
