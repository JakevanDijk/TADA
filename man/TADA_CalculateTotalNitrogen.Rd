\usage{
TADA_CalculateTotalNitrogen(.data, sum_ref, daily_agg)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe. If user wants to consider grouping nitrogen
subspecies across multiple organizations, user should have run
TADA_FindNearbySites and grouped all nearby sites to one common
MonitoringLocationIdentifier, TADA.LatitudeMeasure, TADA.LonigtudeMeasure,
etc.}

\item{sum_ref}{Optional. A custom summation reference dataframe the user has
loaded into the R environment. Dataframe must have same columns as default
TADA.summation reference table.}

\item{daily_agg}{The function used to aggregate to a single
characteristic-unit-fraction-speciation at the same location and depth on
the same day for multiple measurements. Defaults to 'max', but can be set
to 'min' or 'mean'.}
}
\value{
Input TADA dataframe with additional rows representing total N
summation values from adding up subspecies. These new rows share the same
date and monitoring location as the subspecies, but an additional note is
added in the TADA.NSummation.Flag column describing how the total was
derived.
@export
}
\description{
This function uses the \href{https://echo.epa.gov/trends/loading-tool/resources/nutrient-aggregation#nitrogen}{Nutrient Aggregation logic}
from ECHO's Water Pollutant Loading Tool to add nitrogen subspecies together
to approximate a total nitrogen value on a single day at a single site. Where
necessary, it uses conversion factors to convert nitrogen subspecies
expressed as nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, ammonium, etc. to as nitrogen based
on the atomic weights of the different elements in the compound. The
reference table is contained within the package but may be edited/customized
by users.
