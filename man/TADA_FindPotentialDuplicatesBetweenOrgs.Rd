\title{Identify Potential Duplicate Data Uploads Between Organizations (UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT)}
\usage{
TADA_FindPotentialDuplicatesBetweenOrgs(.data, dist_buffer = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{dist_buffer}{Numeric. The distance in meters below which two sites with
measurements at the same time on the same day of the same parameter will
be flagged as potential duplicates.}
}
\value{
The same input TADA dataframe with additional columns: a
TADA.ProbableDuplicate column indicating if there is evidence that two or
more results are duplicated, a TADA.DuplicateID column, containing a
number unique to results that may represent duplicated measurement events,
and one or more TADA.SiteGroup columns indicating monitoring locations
within the distance buffer from each other.
}
\description{
Identifies data records uploaded by different organizations with the same date,
time, characteristic name, and result value within X meters of each other and
flags as potential duplicates. However, it is at the discretion of the data user
to determine if the data records are unique or represent overlap that could cause
issues in the data analysis.
