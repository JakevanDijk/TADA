\usage{
AboveNationalWQXUpperThreshold(.data, clean = TRUE, errorsonly = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; removes data that is above the upper WQX
threshold from the dataframe when clean = TRUE. Default is clean = TRUE.}

\item{errorsonly}{Boolean argument; filters dataframe to show only the data
flagged as above the upper WQX threshold. Default is errorsonly = FALSE.}
}
\value{
When clean = FALSE and errorsonly = FALSE, a column which flags data above the
upper WQX threshold is appended to the dataframe. When clean = FALSE and
errorsonly = TRUE, the dataframe is filtered to show only data found above
the WQX threshold. When clean = TRUE and errorsonly = FALSE, rows with values
that are above the upper WQX threshold are removed from the dataframe and no
column is appended. When clean = TRUE and and errorsonly = TRUE, the function
is not executed and an error message is returned. Defaults are clean = TRUE and
errorsonly = FALSE.
}
\description{
EPA's Water Quality Exchange (WQX) has generated statistics and data from
millions of water quality data points around the country. This function
leverages the statistical data from WQX to flag any data that is above the
upper threshold of result values submitted to WQX for a given characteristic.
When clean = FALSE and errorsonly = FALSE, a column which flags data above the
upper WQX threshold is appended to the dataframe. When clean = FALSE and
errorsonly = TRUE, the dataframe is filtered to show only data found above
the WQX threshold. When clean = TRUE and errorsonly = FALSE, rows with values
that are above the upper WQX threshold are removed from the dataframe and no
column is appended. When clean = TRUE and and errorsonly = TRUE, the function
is not executed and an error message is returned. Defaults are clean = TRUE and
errorsonly = FALSE.

\examples{
# Load example dataset:
data(Nutrients_Utah)

# Remove data that is above the upper WQX threshold from dataframe:
WQXUpperThreshold_clean <- AboveNationalWQXUpperThreshold(Nutrients_Utah)

# Flag, but do not remove, data that is above the upper WQX threshold in
# new column titled "AboveWQXUpperThreshold":
WQXUpperThreshold_flags <- AboveNationalWQXUpperThreshold(Nutrients_Utah, clean = FALSE)

# Show only data flagged as above the upper WQX threshold:
WQXUpperThreshold_flagsonly <- AboveNationalWQXUpperThreshold(Nutrients_Utah, clean = FALSE, errorsonly = TRUE)
