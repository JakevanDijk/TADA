\description{
EPA's Water Quality Exchange (WQX) has generated statistics and data from 
millions of water quality data points around the country. This functions 
leverages that statistical data from WQX to flag any data that is above the 
upper threshold of result values submitted to WQX for a given characteristic.
When clean = TRUE, rows with values that are above the upper WQX threshold
are removed from the dataset and no column will be appended. Default is
clean = FALSE.
