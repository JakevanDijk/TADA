\title{Large WQP data pulls using dataRetrieval}
\usage{
TADABigdataRetrieval(
  startDate = "null",
  endDate = "null",
  statecode = "null",
  huc = "null",
  characteristicName = "null",
  siteType = "null",
  sampleMedia = "Water",
  applyautoclean = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{startDate}{Start Date YYYY-MM-DD format, for example, "1995-01-01"}

\item{endDate}{end date in YYYY-MM-DD format, for example, "2020-12-31"}

\item{statecode}{Character/character vector. State/territory abbreviations from FIPS codes consist of two letters}

\item{huc}{A numeric code denoting a hydrologic unit. Example: "04030202". Different size hucs can be entered.}

\item{characteristicName}{Name of water quality parameter}

\item{siteType}{Name of water body type (e.g., "Stream", "Lake, Reservoir, Impoundment")}

\item{sampleMedia}{Defaults to "Water". Refer to WQP domain tables for other options.}

\item{applyautoclean}{Defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, runs TADA's autoclean function on final combined dataset.}
}
\value{
TADA-compatible dataframe
}
\description{
This function does multiple synchronous data calls to the WQP
(waterqualitydata.us). It uses the WQP summary service to limit the amount
downloaded to only relevant data, and pulls back data from 100 stations at a
time and then joins the data back together and produces a single TADA
compatible dataframe as the output. For large data sets, that can save a lot
of time and ultimately reduce the complexity of subsequent data processing.
Using this function, you will be able to download all data available from all
sites in the contiguous United States that is available for the time period,
characteristicName, and siteType requested. Computer memory may limit the
size of datasets that your R console will be able to hold in one session.
Function requires a characteristicName, siteType, statecode, huc, or start/
end date input. The recommendation is to be as specific as you can with your
large data call.
}
\details{
Similarly to the TADAdataRetrieval function, this function will create
and/or edit the following columns:
TADA.DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Flag
DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue
DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Original
ResultMeasureValue.Original
TADA.ResultMeasureValue.Flag
ResultMeasureValue

All data cleaning and transformations are done directly to the
"ResultMeasureValue" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue" columns,
however the original "ResultMeasureValue" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue"
columns and values from the WQP are preserved in these new fields,
"ResultMeasureValue.Original" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Original".
Additionally, "TADA.ResultMeasureValue.Flag" and
"TADA.DetectionLimitMeasureValue.Flag" are created to track and changes made
to the "ResultMeasureValue" and "DetectionLimitMeasureValue" columns;
and to provide information about the result values that is needed to address
censored data later on (i.e., nondetections)

Some code for this function was adapted from this USGS Blog (Author: Aliesha Krall)
