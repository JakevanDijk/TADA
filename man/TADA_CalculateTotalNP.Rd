\title{Calculate Total Nitrogen and Phosphorus}
\usage{
TADA_CalculateTotalNP(.data, sum_ref, daily_agg = c("max", "min", "mean"))
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe, ideally harmonized using TADA_HarmonizeSynonyms.
If user wants to consider grouping N or P subspecies across multiple
organizations, user should have run TADA_FindNearbySites and grouped all
nearby sites to one common MonitoringLocationIdentifier,
TADA.LatitudeMeasure, TADA.LongitudeMeasure, etc.}

\item{sum_ref}{Optional. A custom summation reference dataframe the user has
loaded into the R environment. Dataframe must have same columns as default
TADA.summation reference table.}

\item{daily_agg}{The function used to aggregate to a single
characteristic-unit-fraction-speciation at the same location and depth on
the same day for multiple measurements. Defaults to 'max', but can be set
to 'min' or 'mean'.}
}
\value{
Input TADA dataframe with additional rows representing total N and P
summation values from adding up subspecies. Note that for total phosphorus,
these additional rows are simply a re-classification of phosphorus or
phosphate into the total phosphorus as P format. These new rows share the
same date and monitoring location as the subspecies, but an additional note
is added in the TADA.NutrientSummation.Flag column describing how the total
was derived. Also adds TADA.NutrientSummationGroup and
TADA.NutrientSummationEquation columns, which can be used to trace how the
total was calculated and from which subspecies.
}
\description{
This function uses the \href{https://echo.epa.gov/trends/loading-tool/resources/nutrient-aggregation#nitrogen}{Nutrient Aggregation logic}
from ECHO's Water Pollutant Loading Tool to add nitrogen subspecies together
to approximate a total nitrogen value on a single day at a single site.
Before summing subspecies, this function runs TADA_AggregateMeasurements to
obtain the max value of a characteristic-fraction-speciation at a given site,
date, and depth. Where necessary, it uses conversion factors to convert
nitrogen subspecies expressed as nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, ammonium, etc. to
as nitrogen based on the atomic weights of the different elements in the
compound. The reference table is contained within the package but may be
edited/customized by users. Future development may include total P summations
as well.
