\title{Generate Unique Synonym Reference Table}
\usage{
TADA_GetSynonymRef(.data, download = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{download}{Boolean argument; when download = TRUE, the output is
downloaded to the current working directory.}
}
\value{
Synonym Reference Table unique to the input dataframe
}
\description{
Function generates a synonym reference table containing all unique
combinations of TADA.CharacteristicName, TADA.ResultSampleFractionText,
TADA.MethodSpecificationName, and TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode. The
function also joins in some TADA-specific suggested synonyms for nutrients
and priority parameters. These target synonyms (denoted in the reference
table with the prefix "Target.") are intended to help the user aggregate
synonymous data that may be uploaded with slightly different metadata
conventions and prepare nutrient data for total N and P summations. Users can
review how their input data relates to target synonyms for
TADA.CharacteristicName, TADA.ResultSampleFractionText,
TADA.MethodSpecificationName, and TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode. Once
the synonym table is created, users may optionally edit the target columns in
the reference table to meet their needs. Additionally, the function assumes
the user has already removed any data containing invalid
characteristic-unit-fraction-speciation combinations (i.e. user has already
run TADA_FlagFraction, TADA_FlagSpeciation, TADA_FlagResultUnit, etc.).

\examples{
# Load example dataset:
data(Data_Nutrients_UT)

# Create a synonym reference table for dataframe:
CreateRefTable <- TADA_GetSynonymRef(Data_Nutrients_UT)

# Create and download (to your working directory) a synonym reference
# table for dataframe: 
\dontrun{
DownloadRefTable <- TADA_GetSynonymRef(Data_Nutrients_UT, download = TRUE)
}
