\usage{
AggregatedContinuousData(.data, clean = TRUE, errorsonly = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; removes aggregated continuous data from
the dataframe when clean = TRUE. Default is clean = TRUE.}

\item{errorsonly}{Boolean argument; filters dataframe to show only aggregated
continuous data when errorsonly = TRUE. Default is errorsonly = FALSE.}
}
\value{
When clean = FALSE and errorsonly = FALSE, a column flagging rows with
aggregated continuous data is appended to the input data set. When clean = FALSE
and errorsonly = TRUE, the dataframe is filtered to show only the flagged
aggregated continuous data and flag column is still appended. When clean = TRUE
and errorsonly = FALSE, aggregated continuous data is removed from the dataframe
and no column is appended. The default is clean = TRUE and errorsonly = FALSE.

\description{
The Water Quality Portal (WQP) is not currently designed to store high-frequency
sensor data (more than 1 value per day). However, sometimes data providers
choose to aggregate their continuous data to a daily avg, max, or min value,
and then submit that aggregated data to the WQP through WQX. Alternatively,
some organizations aggregate their high frequency data (15 min or 1 hour data)
to 2 or 4 hour interval averages, and they also submit that data to the WQP through WQX.
This type of high frequency data may (or may not) be suitable for integration with discrete
water quality data for assessments. Therefore, this function uses metadata
submitted by data providers to flag rows with aggregated continuous data.
This is done by flagging results where the ResultDetectionConditionText =
"Reported in Raw Data (attached)". When clean = FALSE and errorsonly = FALSE, a column titled
"TADA.AggregatedContinuousData" is added to the dataframe to indicate if the row
includes aggregated continuous data, "Y", or not,  "N". When clean = FALSE and
errorsonly = TRUE, the dataframe will be filtered to show only the rows flagged
"Y" for aggregated continuous data. When clean = TRUE and errorsonly = FALSE,
rows with aggregated continuous data are removed from the dataframe and no
column will be appended. When clean = TRUE and errorsonly = TRUE, the function
does not execute and an error message is returned. The default is clean = TRUE
and errorsonly = FALSE.

\examples{
# Load example dataset
data(Nutrients_Utah)

# Remove aggregated continuous data from dataframe:
AggContinuous_clean <- AggregatedContinuousData(Nutrients_Utah)

# Flag, but do not remove, aggregated continuous data in new column titled "TADA.AggregatedContinuousData":
AggContinuous_flags <- AggregatedContinuousData(Nutrients_Utah, clean = FALSE)

# Show only rows flagged for aggregated continuous data:
AggContinuous_errorsonly <- AggregatedContinuousData(Nutrients_Utah, clean = FALSE, errorsonly = TRUE)
}
