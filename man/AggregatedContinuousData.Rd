\description{
The Water Quality Portal (WQP) is not designed to store high-frequency 
(i.e. sensor) data. However, sometimes data providers choose to aggregate
their continuous data and submit it to WQP as one value. This type of data
may not be suitable for a water quality assessment, therefore, this function
uses metadata submitted by data providers to flags rows with aggregated 
continuous data. When clean = TRUE, rows with aggregated continuous data
are removed from the dataset.
