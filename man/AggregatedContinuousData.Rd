\title{Check for Aggregated Continuous Data}
\usage{
AggregatedContinuousData(.data, clean = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; removes aggregated continuous data from
the dataframe when clean = TRUE. Default is clean = TRUE.}
}
\value{
When clean = FALSE, a column flagging rows with aggregated continuous
data is appended to the input data set. When clean = TRUE, aggregated
continuous data is removed from the dataframe.
}
\description{
The Water Quality Portal (WQP) is not currently designed to store high-frequency
sensor data (more than 1 value per day). However, sometimes data providers
choose to aggregate their continuous data to a daily avg, max, or min value,
and then submit that aggregated data to the WQP through WQX. Alternatively,
some organizations aggregate their high frequency data (15 min or 1 hour data)
to 2 or 4 hour interval averages, and they also submit that data to the WQP through WQX.
This type of high frequency data may (or may not) be suitable for integration with discrete
water quality data for assessments. Therefore, this function uses metadata
submitted by data providers to flag rows with aggregated continuous data.
This is done by flagging results where the ResultDetectionConditionText =
"Reported in Raw Data (attached)". When clean = FALSE, a column titled
"TADA.AggregatedContinuousData" is added to the dataframe to indicate if the row
includes aggregated continuous data, "Y", or not,  "N". When clean = TRUE,
rows with aggregated continuous data are removed from the dataframe and no
column will be appended. The default is clean = TRUE.

\examples{
# Load example dataset
data(Nutrients_Utah)

# Remove aggregated continuous data from dataframe:
AggContinuous_clean <- AggregatedContinuousData(Nutrients_Utah)

# Flag, but do not remove, aggregated continuous data in new column titled "TADA.AggregatedContinuousData":
AggContinuous_flags <- AggregatedContinuousData(Nutrients_Utah, clean = FALSE)
}
