\usage{
AggregatedContinuousData(.data, clean = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{TADA dataframe}

\item{clean}{Boolean argument; removes aggregated continuous data from 
the dataset when clean = TRUE. Default is clean = TRUE.}
}
\value{
When clean = FALSE, a column flagging rows with aggregated continuous
data is appended to the input data set. When clean = TRUE, aggregated 
continuous data is removed from the dataset.
}
\description{
The Water Quality Portal (WQP) is not designed to store high-frequency 
sensor data. However, sometimes data providers choose to aggregate
their continuous data and submit it to WQP as one value. This type of data
may not be suitable for integration with discrete water quality data for 
assessments. Therefore, this function uses metadata submitted by data providers
to flags rows with aggregated continuous data. This is done by flagging results 
where the ResultDetectionConditionText = "Reported in Raw Data (attached)". 
When clean = TRUE, rows with aggregated continuous data are removed from the
dataset and no column will be appended. Default is clean = TRUE.
