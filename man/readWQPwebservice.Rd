Go to the WQP website (https://www.waterqualitydata.us/) and fill out the
advanced query form. Choose the Full Physical Chemical Data Profile, all data
sources, and the file format Comma-Separated. When finished, do not hit the
download button. Instead, copy the web service URL located at the bottom of
the page under the header "Result". Use that "Result" web service URL as the
input for this function to download data directly into R.
