WQP, where each row represents a unique data record. Data frame must
include the columns 'TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier',
'TADA.ResultMeasureValue', and 'TADA.ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode' to run
this function. 'TADA.ComparableDataIdentifier' can be added to the data
frame by running the function TADA_HarmonizeSynonyms(). The user can include
additional grouping columns in the id_col input. If more than one group
exists in the dataset (i.e. two or more unique comparable data
identifiers), the function creates a list of plots, where each list element
name is a unique group identifier.</p></dd>
